## 📊 Dataset
- Tesla stock price data downloaded from Yahoo Finance using the `yfinance` library.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Pandas 📚
- NumPy ➕
- Matplotlib 📈
- Statsmodels 📊
- Scikit-learn ⚙️
- yfinance 📉

## 📝 Steps Involved

### Step 1: Data Collection
- Imported necessary libraries.
- Downloaded historical stock price data for Tesla.
- Displayed the initial data structure.

### Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Checked for missing values.
- Analyzed the structure of the DataFrame.
- Visualized the closing prices over time. 📅

### Step 3: Time Series Forecasting
- Split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
- Fitted an ARIMA model to the training data.
- Forecasted stock prices and evaluated the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- Visualized actual vs. predicted prices. 📉

### Step 4: Data Structures and Algorithms Integration
- Implemented binary search to find stock prices on specific dates. 🔍
- Used heaps to find the top 5 highest and lowest stock prices. 🏆
- Applied dynamic programming to calculate the maximum profit from stock prices. 💰

## Machine Learning Component
- **Random Forest Regression**
  - Prepared the dataset by selecting features.
  - Split the data into training and testing sets.
  - Trained a Random Forest Regressor on the training set.
  - Made predictions and calculated performance metrics like RMSE and R² score. 📊

## 🔍 Model Evaluation and Visualization
- Visualized actual vs. forecasted stock prices. 📈
- Displayed forecasted prices.

## 📥 Installation
